@inproceedings{hastedt2022,
 abstract = {Nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) is a methodology that obtains a nonlinear control law that globally reduces system dynamics with respect to selected control variables to a chain of integrators. However, this approach is sensitive to model uncertainties. In this paper, a cascaded NDI based load factor controller is designed for the longitudinal dynamics of a scaled ﬂight test aircraft and its performance is compared to an established gain scheduled controller. Due to the fast inner control loop, unmodeled actuator dynamics and time delays negatively aﬀect the system. The eﬀects of unmodeled actuator dynamics and time delays on NDI are therefore investigated analytically and in simulation. We propose measures to improve performance in the presence of unmodeled actuator dynamics and time delays. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed NDI controller is compared to the performance of an established gain-scheduled controller.},

The dynamic model is built in MATLAB/Simulink environment that incorporates propulsion, aerodynamics, environmental, weight, and the engines with Thrust Vectoring Control (TVC), all in the LV six degrees of freedoms. The model also incorporated the multistage rocket simulation, where separation will immediately reduce masses and change aerodynamic characteristics. Falcon 9 LV, by SpaceX, is used as the research subject, in its operation to bring cargo to a parking orbit. Three simulation runs to test the model capability is conducted, including (1) open loop point mass simulation, (2) open loop full dynamic simulation, and (3) closed loop with TVC simulation. The final simulation shows conformity With the real LV launch data, suggesting that the model can be used as a base for control and launch schedule design.},

@phdthesis{kamath2021,
 abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to systematically develop the underlying theory behind and implementation of an integrated framework for analytical multibody dynamics modeling and closed-loop simulations with novel control strategies for the powered-descent and precision landing of rocket-powered space vehicles. The thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the rocket-landing problem and the motivation for developing new methods and algorithms to enable future planetary landing missions. Chapter 2 describes the implementation of a globally-optimal minimum-propellant powered-descent guidance (PDG) algorithm using lossless convexification and convex optimization. Chapter 3 explains the analytical formulation of the nonlinear equations of motion for a variable-mass multibody rocket system using the extended Kane's equations, and shows results from an open-loop simulation run with the optimal control commands obtained from guidance. Chapter 4 describes feedback control in detail, including a novel method for the design of internally stabilizing multivariable robust feedback controllers using Youla parameterization, along with its application to the underactuated lunar landing problem with feedback control only. Chapter 5 provides an algorithm for the design of internally stabilizing robust LPV controllers via Youla parameterization and applies it to the underactuated lunar landing scenario in a combined feedforward-feedback control architecture with propellant-optimal guidance, control allocation, and various actuator considerations. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis with key observations regarding the work done, the results obtained, the specific contributions, and potential directions for future research.},

abstract = {A direct coning mitigation algorithm based on the detection of a sinusoidal component in the gyro measurements is proposed. The coning error, which is one of dominant error sources affecting the accuracy of attitude computation in the inertial navigation system (INS), is induced by the sinusoidal motion such as a manoeuvre of vehicle or the vibration of a dithering of ring laser gyro. However, many researchers have developed coning error mitigation algorithms based on the higher-order polynomial model and its correction terms are extracted from the gyro output without faithful consideration of the periodicity of motion. Hence, the authors first detect and estimate the sinusoidal components from gyro measurements, and then find the higher-order correction terms from the estimated sinusoidal parameters. The authors also show that this algorithm can be applied to the mitigation of sculling error because of its duality to the coning motion. Simulation results show that the direct compensation algorithm works effectively for the navigation of vehicles with continuous and steady oscillations. Also, the rate table test with HG1700 inertial measurement unit (IMU) is conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm on real INS signal.},

@book{kuipers2020,
 abstract = {Ever since the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton introduced quaternions in the nineteenth century--a feat he celebrated by carving the founding equations into a stone bridge--mathematicians and engineers have been fascinated by these mathematical objects. Today, they are used in applications as various as describing the geometry of spacetime, guiding the Space Shuttle, and developing computer applications in virtual reality. In this book, J. B. Kuipers introduces quaternions for scientists and engineers who have not encountered them before and shows how they can be used in a variety of practical situations. The book is primarily an exposition of the quaternion, a 4-tuple, and its primary application in a rotation operator. But Kuipers also presents the more conventional and familiar 3 x 3 (9-element) matrix rotation operator. These parallel presentations allow the reader to judge which approaches are preferable for specific applications. The volume is divided into three main parts. The opening chapters present introductory material and establish the book's terminology and notation. The next part presents the mathematical properties of quaternions, including quaternion algebra and geometry. It includes more advanced special topics in spherical trigonometry, along with an introduction to quaternion calculus and perturbation theory, required in many situations involving dynamics and kinematics. In the final section, Kuipers discusses state-of-the-art applications. He presents a six degree-of-freedom electromagnetic position and orientation transducer and concludes by discussing the computer graphics necessary for the development of applications in virtual reality

Automatic implementations of the complex-step method for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and compared to existing algorithmic differentiation tools. The complex-step method is tested in two large multidisciplinary solvers and the resulting sensitivities are compared to results given by finite differences. The resulting sensitivities are shown to be as accurate as the analyses. Accuracy, robustness, ease of implementation and maintainability make these complex-step derivative approximation tools very attractive options for sensitivity analysis.},

@article{mayhew2011,
 abstract = {It is well known that controlling the attitude of a rigid body is subject to topological constraints. We illustrate, with examples, the problems that arise when using continuous and (memoryless) discontinuous quaternion-based state-feedback control laws for global attitude stabilization. We propose a quaternion-based hybrid feedback scheme that solves the global attitude tracking problem in three scenarios: full state measurements, only measurements of attitude, and measurements of attitude with angular velocity measurements corrupted by a constant bias. In each case, the hybrid feedback is dynamic and incorporates hysteresis-based switching using a single binary logic variable for each quaternion error state. When only attitude measurements are available or the angular rate is corrupted by a constant bias, the proposed controller is observer-based and incorporates an additional quaternion filter and bias observer. The hysteresis mechanism enables the proposed scheme to simultaneously avoid the ``unwinding phenomenon'' and sensitivity to arbitrarily small measurement noise that is present in discontinuous feedbacks. These properties are shown using a general framework for hybrid systems, and the results are demonstrated by simulation.},

The dynamics of a three-axis stabilized spacecraft with a single partially-filled fuel tank are formulated and the sloshing propellant is modeled as a multi-mass--spring system, where the oscillation frequencies of the mass--spring elements represent the prominent sloshing modes. The equations of motion are expressed in terms of the three-dimensional spacecraft translational velocity vector, the attitude, the angular velocity, and the internal coordinates representing the slosh modes. A Lyapunov-based nonlinear feedback control law is proposed to control the translational velocity vector and the attitude of the spacecraft, while attenuating the sloshing modes characterizing the internal dynamics. A simulation example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the control law.},

@article{seiler2020,
 abstract = {This article provides a tutorial introduction to disk margins. These are robust stability measures that account for simuitaneous gain and phase perturbations in a feedback system. The article first reviews the classical (gain only and phase -only) margins and their limitations. This motivates the use of disk margins, which are defined using a set of perturbations that has simuitaneous gain and phase variations. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided to compute the disk margin for a single -input, single -output feedback system. Frequency -dependent disk margins can also be computed, yielding additional insight. The article concludes with a discussion of stability margins for multiple -input, multiple output (MIMO) feedback systems. A typical approach is to assess robust stability {\textquotedbl}loop -at -a -time,{\textquotedbl} with a perturbation introduced into a single channel and all other channels held at their nominal values. MIMO disk margins provide a useful extension to consider simultaneous variations in multiple channels. This multiloop analysis can provide a more accurate robustness assessment as compared to the one -loop -at -a -time approach.},

Flight Dynamics takes a new approach to the science and mathematics of aircraft flight, unifying principles of aeronautics with contemporary systems analysis. While presenting traditional material that is critical to understanding aircraft motions, it does so in the context of modern computational tools and multivariable methods. Robert Stengel devotes particular attention to models and techniques that are appropriate for analysis, simulation, evaluation of flying qualities, and control system design. He establishes bridges to classical analysis and results, and explores new territory that was treated only inferentially in earlier books. This book combines a highly accessible style of presentation with contents that will appeal to graduate students and to professionals already familiar with basic flight dynamics. Dynamic analysis has changed dramatically in recent decades, with the introduction of powerful personal computers and scientific programming languages. Analysis programs have become so pervasive that it can be assumed that all students and practicing engineers working on aircraft flight dynamics have access to them. Therefore, this book presents the principles, derivations, and equations of flight dynamics with frequent reference to MATLAB functions and examples. By using common notation and not assuming a strong background in aeronautics, Flight Dynamics will engage a wide variety of readers. Introductions to aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, flying qualities, flight control, and the atmospheric and gravitational environment accompany the development of the aircraft's dynamic equations},

It presents a comprehensive treatment of both atmospheric and space flight control systems including aircraft, rockets (missiles and launch vehicles), entry vehicles and spacecraft (both orbital and attitude control). The broad coverage of topics emphasizes the synergies among the various flight control systems and attempts to show their evolution from the same set of physical principles as well as their design and analysis by similar mathematical tools. In addition, this book presents state-of-art control system design methods - including multivariable, optimal, robust, digital and nonlinear strategies - as applied to modern flight control systems. Advanced Control of Aircraft, Missiles and Spacecraft features worked-out examples and problems at the end of each chapter as well as a number of MATLAB/ SIMULINK examples that are realistic and representative of the state-of-the-art in flight control{\textquotedbl}--

 abstract = {A design method of thrust vector control missile attitude control system is presented in this paper. Firstly, the short period motion model of thrust vector missile is established. Secondly the attitude controllers of pitch, yaw and roll channels are designed based on ADRC (Active disturbance rejection control technology), and the control structures of pitch, yaw and roll channels are given. In pitch (yaw, roll) channel, the pitch (yaw, roll) angular velocity loop is used to track the command of pitch (yaw, roll) angular velocity rapidly, and the angle of attack (sideslip angle, roll angle) loop is used to track the command of angle of attack (sideslip angle, roll angle) rapidly. Finally, the stability of the designed closed-loop system is proved by Lyapunov method. The thrust vector control missile model designed by this method is simulated numerically, and the results show that the designed missile attitude has good response characteristics.},
